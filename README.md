Paper to Git ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maxking/paper-to-git.svg?branch=master)
============

This project aims to sync documents between [Dropbox Paper][0] and any local Git
repository. Why? Because apart from all other features that Paper has, it is
an excellent in-browser markdown editor.

This is an effort to create and automate Paper->Github Pages workflow, where I
can create and publish my blog posts by writing them in dropbox paper and
automatically fetching it from there and publishing it in Github Pages.

_Current State_: This project is currently in its very initial stages and
nothing is guaranteed to work. I will update this as the project moves forward.
